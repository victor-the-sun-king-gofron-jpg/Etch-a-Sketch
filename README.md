The basic premise of this project to create an interactive Etch-a-Sketch for users to play around with

v1.
User can click to enable the pen to Draw
It will draw in Black but can be toggled to be colorful by hitting the button
at the bottom
Reset Grid button will allow the user to clear the grid and set the new dimensions

v2 Plans
Want to enable a way that users can toggle between when the pen draws and when it does not
Want to enable reset grid not to crash the grid when user doesn't input a number
